##Playing with data and education progression

Hello World!

Just figuring this place out. More updates to come soon.

## A little about me

I found statistics in my 'last' year of college. I was not sure what I would use my math for, but I knew I also wanted to code. Data analysis was love at first sight. Since that first semester I have dedicated my life to becoming the best data scientist I could be. It has been a long road, with school, family and relationships. I knew statistics and I knew how to program, but I had no idea how the acctually went together. Over the past year I have learned exactly how they go together, and how much I don't know. Every day I learn more and I am excited to continue learning.

Beyond learning, I enjoy cooking simple meals for my friends and family, riding my bike, swimming in the river, and more. My life has been well rounded with good books and physical activity. 

Enough about me. Let's go parse some data sets.
