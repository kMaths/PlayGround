#Manipultating Data with dplyr

#tabular = presented in a table
#ftp = file transfer protocol
library(dplyr)
mydf <- read.csv(path2csv, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
dim(mydf)
head(mydf)
packageVersion("dplyr")

#load data into 'data frame tbl' or 'tbl_df'
cran <- tbl_df(mydf)

#remove original data frame from workspace to avoid confusion
rm('mydf')

#printing is the advantage
cran
#More informative and compact
#class and dimension are shown
#automatically shows the first 10 rows and only columns that fit

#five verbs that cover fundamentals of data manipulation
#select(), filter(), arrange(), mutate(), and summarize()

?select
#select subsets columns
select(cran, ip_id, package, country)
#note, we didn't have to say ip_id$cran. dplyr is smart like that

#we can use this notation in the select function
